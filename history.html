        The GAA had seven founding members, but the driving force behind its establishment was Michael Cusack. An Irish teacher from close to The Burren in County Clare, Cusack was what is called a ‘romantic nationalist.’ He was active in the fight of the Gaelic revival to preserve the Irish language and deplored the decline of Irish customs and games that had accompanied British occupation.
